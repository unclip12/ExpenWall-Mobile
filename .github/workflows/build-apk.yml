# 🚀 AUTOMATIC BUILD ON EVERY PUSH!
#
# This workflow triggers on:
#   1. Every push to main branch - Automatic builds
#   2. Version tags (v2.3.1, v2.4.0, etc.) - For official releases
#   3. Manual trigger from GitHub Actions UI - For testing
#
# Changed from tag-only builds to automatic builds per user request.
# Builds will now start immediately after any code changes are pushed.

on:
  # Trigger on every push to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'  # Also keep version tag support
  
  # Allow manual trigger from Actions tab
